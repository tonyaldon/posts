* About

The posts about "emacs/elisp" that I publish on the subreddit
[[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/][r/emacs]] in an org document.

You can also read them at https://posts.tonyaldon.com.

* Install

The posts are in the file [[./posts.org]] and this file is meant to be
read inside Emacs.

To make the internal local links to Emacs and Org-mode repositories
work correctly, make sure to clone those repositories

#+BEGIN_SRC text
$ git clone https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs
$ git clone https://git.sr.ht/~bzg/org-mode
#+END_SRC

and to have ~org-rev~ packages installed.

You also have to add entries for emacs and org-mode in the plist
~org-rev-repos~.  For instance, if you have cloned emacs repository
under the directory ~/path/to/emacs/~ and org-mode under the directory
~/path/to/org-mode/~ you can run the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'org-rev-repos
             '(:repo-abbrev "emacs"
               :repo-dir "/path/to/emacs/"
               :repo-url "https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs"))
(add-to-list 'org-rev-repos
             '(:repo-abbrev "org-mode"
               :repo-dir "/path/to/org-mode/"
               :repo-url "https://git.sr.ht/~bzg/org-mode"))
#+END_SRC
