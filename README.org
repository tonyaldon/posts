* About

The posts about "emacs/elisp" that I publish on the subreddit
[[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/][r/emacs]] in an org document.

* Install

The posts are in the file [[./posts.org]] and this file is meant to be
read inside Emacs.

To make the internal local links to Emacs and Org-mode repositories
work correctly, make sure to clone those repositories.

A clean procedure to get started with this document is:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone https://github.com/tonyaldon/posts
cd posts
git clone git://git.sv.gnu.org/emacs.git
git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/emacs/org-mode.git
#+END_SRC
